To the demo you'll need to serve the files, as the scripts make
cross origin requests.

You can use something like [http-server][0], 
or alternatively, from the Lap project root:

1. `npm install`
2. `grunt connect`

With the `grunt-connect` server running, you can access the demo by navigating
to [localhost:3000/demo][1]

[0]: https://www.npmjs.org/package/http-server
[1]: localhost:3000/demo
