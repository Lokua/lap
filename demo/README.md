To run most of the demos you'll need to serve the files, as the scripts make
cross origin requests.

You can use something like [http-server](https://www.npmjs.org/package/http-server), or
alternatively, from the Lap project root:

1. `npm install`
2. `grunt connect`

With the `grunt-connect` server running, and you can access the file 
from [localhost:3000/demo/basic/album.html](localhost:3000/demo/basic/album.html)
