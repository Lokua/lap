# TODO

+ ~~kill selectorPrefix settings - pain in the ass, not good for plugins~~
+ ~~mode selectors and defaults to prototype, no point in keeping in closure~~
+ ~~RaphaelControls should no longer be in the dist folder. Move to demo - update Gruntfile~~
+ ~~Gruntfile: update build to reflect debug tasks
  (currently hides tooly from global namespace - pointless if 
  using tooly elsewhere)~~
+ ~~mousings~~
  - ~~enter wrapper -> show, unless mousedown(may have left and reentered) =entered~~
  - ~~if mousedown  -> =mouseDown~~
  - ~~leave wrapper -> hide, unless mouseDown, =left~~
  - ~~if mouseup and =left, hide, !=left~~  

## CSS Demo

+ vertical align all icons (like album-steps)
+ hide controls and slide vslider left when active (and reverse)
+ ~~icon hover~~
+ volumeRange tooltip
+ album thumb should change album
